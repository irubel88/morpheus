We choose this name as it is the dream DSL for any Scala/SQL user, finessed to perfection up to the Websudos quality standard\r\nyou've gotten used to. Also, morpheus stands for morphing. With the single switch of an import, morpheus will perform a full feature swap from MySQL to\r\nOracleSQL for example. It doesn't have a query compiler, instead it entirely mimics the functionality the database has.\r\n\r\nWe've taken it up ourselves to produce the highest quality database integration tooling for all Scala users, \r\ncurrently hitting that bar for Cassandra and Neo4J. But why stop there?\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing morpheus\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThe current version is: ```val morpheusVersion = 0.2.3```.\r\n\r\nMorpheus is actively and avidly developed. It is not yet production ready, so trial at your own risk.\r\n\r\n- The stable release is always available on Maven Central and will be indicated by the badge at the top of this readme. The Maven Central badge is pointing at the latest version\r\n\r\n- Intermediary releases are available through our managed Bintray repository available at `https://dl.bintray.com/websudos/oss-releases/`. The latest version available on our Bintray repository is indicated by the Bintray badge at the top of this readme.\r\n\r\n<a id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of contents</a>\r\n===============================================\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li><a href=\"#design-philosophy\">Design philosophy</a></li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"#integrating-morpheus\">Integrating Morpheus</a></li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>Supported databases and documentation</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><a href=\"./docs/MySQL.md\">MySQL</a></li>\r\n      <li><a href=\"./docs/MySQL.md\">MariaDB</a></li>\r\n      <li><a href=\"./docs/Postgres.md\">Postgres</a></li>\r\n      <li><a href=\"./docs/Oracle.md\">Oracle(Morpheus Enterprise)</a></li>\r\n      <li><a href=\"./docs/MSSQL.md\">MS SQL(Morpheus Enterprise)</a></li>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"#support\">Support</a></li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"#copyright\">Copyright</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"design-philosophy\">Design philosophy</a>\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nYou're probably wondering how Morpheus fairs compared to the more established players in the Scala SQL market and why we set out to do something new in the \r\nfirst place. To sum it up, we believe Slick is an excellent tool but we do not believe you should learn about our abstractions to get things done. A DSL \r\nshould auto-magically encode the same syntax and the logic as the tool it's designed for.\r\n\r\nInstead of learning about primitives and rules we thought of to abstract away discrepancies between the various SQL implementations, \r\nMorpheus features a unique approach, what we call the auto-magical flip. Although at this point in time only MySQL is supported, \r\nMorpheus is designed to give you an \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet through a single import.\r\n\r\nAs follows: ```import com.websudos.morpheus.mysql._```.\r\n\r\nAnd done, you can now define tables, query and so on. Say you have something like this:\r\n\r\n```Recipes.select.distinctRow.where(_.name eqs \"test\")```. ```DISTINCTROW``` doesn't exist in the Postgres ```SELECT``` statement syntax, \r\nbut it's a standard thing as far as MySQL is concerned.\r\n\r\nHere's how Morpheus operates:\r\n\r\nIf you change the top level import to: ```com.websudos.morpheus.postgres._``` and you try to compile the same ```distinctRow``` query. But there \r\nwill be none. The method will simply not exist. Morpheus has now auto-magically performed a full feature swap, \r\nchanged communication protocol and all underlying settings, and all you get now is Postgres features.\r\n\r\nHow? Quite a lot of fun magic under the hood, have a look throughout our decently documented codebase for more information. The beauty of it is that you \r\ndon't have to care. Slick makes it easy to move from one SQL database to the other with less code changes, but if you're well set on a database you already \r\nknow and love, it may be counter productive to have to learn about a framework when you could use Morpheus and all you need is IDE auto-completes to get \r\nlightning fast development productivity. \r\n\r\nOh, and did we mention it's entirely asynchronous and reactive? No JDBC.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"integrating-morpheus\">Integrating Morpheus</a>\r\n======================================================\r\n<a href=\"#table-of-contents\">back to top</a>\r\n\r\nMorpheus is designed to give you an all-you-can eat buffet through a single import, so all you really have to do is to pick the module corresponding to the \r\ndatabase you want to use. At this point in time only MySQL is supported.\r\n\r\nIf you are using MySQL, you would simply use the following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\r\n  \"com.websudos\"  %% \"morpheus-mysql\"                % morpheusVersion\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can: ```import com.websudos.morpheus.mysql._```, which will give you the full set of MySQL methods and features without any overlaps or \r\nunsupported operations. Morpheus guarantees you can almost never write an invalid SQL query unless you try really really hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Available modules ###\r\n\r\nThe full list of available modules is:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\r\n  \"com.websudos\"  %% \"morpheus-dsl\"                  % morpheusVersion,\r\n  \"com.websudos\"  %% \"morpheus-mysql\"                % morpheusVersion,\r\n  \"com.websudos\"  %% \"morpheus-postgres\"             % morpheusVersion\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<a id=\"contributors\">Contributors</a>\r\n=====================================\r\n<a href=\"#table-of-contents\">back to top</a>\r\n\r\nMorpheus was developed by us from scratch in an attempt to evolve the SQL tooling in the Scala ecosystem\r\n to the new level and bring in fully reactive database access while preserving the complete SQL syntax you are used to.\r\n\r\n* Flavian Alexandru @alexflav23\r\n* Benjamin Edwards @benjumanji\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a id=\"support\">Commercial support</a>\r\n======================================\r\n<a href=\"#table-of-contents\">back to top</a>\r\n\r\nWe, the people behind phantom run a software development house specialised in Scala and NoSQL.
